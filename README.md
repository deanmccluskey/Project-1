FriendlySearch is fun search engine that accesses DuckDuckGo's API to render results in a user friendly GUI. 

Results posted include a primary image, an animated GIF obtained from Giphy's API, which spins (using
anime.js) before it lands on the page.

Results also include a short description, a picture, and may offer a URL for additional information. 

All of this is designed to make for a fun and interesting option for internet searches...
